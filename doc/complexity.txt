Introduction
============
This plugin displays the Cyclomatic Complexity of each function in the current buffer. It uses the `get_cyclomatic_complexity` function to calculate the complexity with lizard.

Configuration
=============
*complexity-config*

The default configuration of the plugin is as follows:

>
{
  thresholds = {
    low = 10,     -- CCN <= low is considered low complexity
    medium = 15,  -- CCN > low and <= medium is medium complexity
    -- CCN > medium is high complexity
  },

  virt_prefix = "â®• CCN:", -- text prefix for virtual text
  virt_pos = "eol", -- extmark position ("eol" or "overlay")

  autosave = false, -- set true to annotate on BufWritePost
  autosave_patterns = { "*.php" }, -- file patterns to trigger autosave
}
