Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
 authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

=== TERMS AND CONDITIONS ===

**0. Definitions.**  
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  
“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  
“You” means any person who received a copy of the Program under this License.  
“To modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission.  
“Covered work” means the Program or any work based on the Program.  
“To propagate” means to do anything with the work that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law.  
“Propagation” includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  
“To convey” means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  
An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

**1. Source Code.**  
The “source code” means the preferred form for making modifications, plus any associated interface definition files.

**2. Basic Permissions.**  
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright.

**3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.**  
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law.

**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**  
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code.

**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**  
You may convey a work based on the Program, provided you also meet all conditions.

**6. Object Code and Distribution.**  
You may convey object code under terms compatible with this License.

**7. Additional Terms.**  
Certain additional permissions may be offered.

**8. Termination.**  
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided.

**9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**  
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy.

**10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**  
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license.

**11. Patents.**  
A contributor’s “essential patent claims” become licensed.

**12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.**  
If you cannot convey all the permissions, you may not convey the covered work at all.

**13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.**  
Not allowed.

**14. Revised Versions of this License.**  
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions.

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**  
If you develop a new program, attach the following notice to each source file:

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
